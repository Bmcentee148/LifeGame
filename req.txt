Conway's Game Of Life Simulation

This program MUST:

1. Create a cellular grid given the number of rows and columns.
2. Initialize its state given a sample grid from a text file.
3. Update the state of each cell simutaneously for each generation,
	 based on the given rules.
4. Output the final result in the same format as the input grid.
5. Allow for the rules to 'wrap around' the grid.
	i.e. the neighbors for cells on the edge of the grid 
		 also appear on alternate sides of the grid.
