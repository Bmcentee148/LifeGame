Conway's Game Of Life simulation


This program will simulate a cellular game of life based on the following rules.

1. If a cell has exactly 3 neigbors who are "on" then cell will also turn "on."

2. If a cell has less than two of its neighbors "on" then the cell will turn "off."

3. If a cell has more than three of its neighbors "on" then the cell will turn "off."
